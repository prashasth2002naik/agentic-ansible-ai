# agentic-ansible-ai
Agentic AI system that converts natural language into Ansible automation using open-source LLMs



#Steps to execute
🧱 STEP 1 — Prepare your system (foundation)
1.1 Install OS packages

You need a Linux machine (Ubuntu preferred).

Install basics:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip git ssh ansible

1.2 Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

🧠 STEP 2 — Run an open-source LLM locally

This is your AI brain.

2.1 Install Ollama (open source)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

2.2 Pull open-source models
Reasoning model:
ollama pull mistral

Code / Ansible playbook model:
ollama pull deepseek-coder


✔ Both are fully open source
✔ Runs locally
✔ No internet dependency


Step 3 - clone the git repo

📦 STEP 4 — Install Python dependencies

requirements.txt

fastapi
uvicorn
pyyaml
ansible-runner
requests


-- set up python virtual environment
sudo apt install python3-full python3-venv


python3 -m venv venv


source venv/bin/activate


Install:

pip install -r requirements.txt


step 5 - run code
cd agentic-ansible-ai
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
# after running the above command you have to open a new terminal in the cloned repo and run the below command
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/request-task \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "Ensure the git package is installed using apt on Ubuntu host 172.18.181.36",
  "credentials": {
    "ssh_user": "msis",
    "password": "university"
  }
}'


# text in the above command is you prompt make sure the prompt is very clear and meaningful along with the desired ip's you would like the desired changes to be reflected on and ensure to enter the correct ssh user and password
